# My Android App

This is an Android application I have started a while ago as a side project when I first dived into the Kotlin language. I have had the most fun diving into Android Apps world with its rich and always up to date documentation, the Android Jetpack library suite, and its overwhelmingly helpful and growing community

I have also developped a server API for this App, based on the NodeJS JavaScript runtime and the various libraries it offers.

_See the code base for the [NodeJS-API server](https://github.com/vbounyasit/NodeJS-API)_

_See my [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/0NH0WcIo/android-app) with the technical business rules I implemented_
